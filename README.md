# CS529-HW2
A bottom is created in the web page to show the 70 threshold concentration and to go back to the general concentration.
The velocity and concentration are shown at the same time with different shapes (e.g., triangles and circles). 
The legend colors are changed. Also, your comments on my firt HW is addressed in this legend.
